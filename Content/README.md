# SAFE Template

This template can be used to generate a full-stack web application using the [SAFE Stack](https://safe-stack.github.io/). It was created using the dotnet [SAFE Template](https://safe-stack.github.io/docs/template-overview/). If you want to learn more about the template why not start with the [quick start](https://safe-stack.github.io/docs/quickstart/) guide?

## Install pre-requisites

You'll need to install the following pre-requisites in order to build SAFE applications

* The [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download)
* The [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) package manager (you can also use `npm` but the usage of `yarn` is encouraged).
* [Node LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed for the front end components.
* If you're running on OSX or Linux, you'll also need to install [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/docs/getting-started/install/).

## Work with the application

Before you run the project **for the first time only** you should install its local tools with this command:

```bash
dotnet tool restore
```


To concurrently run the server and the client components in watch mode use the following command:

```bash
dotnet fake build -t run
```
