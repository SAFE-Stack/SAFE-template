# SAFE Template

This template can be used to generate a full-stack web application using the [SAFE Stack](https://safe-stack.github.io/).

## Install pre-requisites

You'll need to install the following pre-requisites in order to build SAFE applications

* [FAKE 5](https://fake.build/) installed as a [global tool](https://fake.build/fake-gettingstarted.html#Install-FAKE)
* The [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) package manager (you an also use `npm` but the usage of `yarn` is encouraged).
* [Node LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed for the front end components.
* If you're running on OSX or Linux, you'll also need to install [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/docs/getting-started/install/).

## Work with the application

To concurrently run the server and the client components in watch mode use the following command:

```bash
fake build -t Run
```

//#if (deploy == "docker")
To build your application as a docker container run the following command:

```bash
fake build -t Docker
```
//#endif
//#if (deploy == "azure")
To deploy your application as an Azure Web App run the following command:

```bash
fake build -t AppService
```
//#endif

## SAFE Stack Documentation

You will find more documentation about the used F# components at the following places:

* [Saturn](https://saturnframework.org/docs/)
* [Fable](https://fable.io/docs/)
* [Elmish](https://elmish.github.io/elmish/)

If you want to know more about the full Azure Stack and all of it's components (including Azure) visit the official [SAFE documentation](https://safe-stack.github.io/docs/).

## Troubleshooting

* **fake not found** - If you fail to execute `fake` from command line after installing it as a global tool, you might need to add it to your `PATH` manually: (e.g. `export PATH="$HOME/.dotnet/tools:$PATH"` on unix) - [related GitHub issue](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues/9321)
